# Worst Java - ever

## Overview

We all know what good code looks like.<br>
Here's your chance to use that knowledge for evil and write your worst Java ever.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repo, and create a branch for yourself.
2. Pick a class, and complete the skeleton method so that the tests still pass, but try and make the implementation as
   horrific to understand at as possible.
3. Create a PR for visibility so we can all see your submission

## Some ideas to get you started

* Use incorrectly named variables/methods/classes
* Make the formatting as horrible as possible
* Break all conventions
* Use Threads, Futures
* Make it overly complicated - add lots of extra classes and methods
* Use lots of casts/conversions
* Perform unnecessary calculations
* Use arrays to be more opaque
* Don't limit yourself to ASCII - use UTF-8, emojis, etc
* Abuse generics
* Add misleading comments
* Use Exceptions to move data around/as part of the execution flow
* Go all "enterprise" on it
* Splash the lambdas and functional programming everywhere

Basically, make it look as horrible as possible.<br>
Do everything you shouldn't.<br>
Even better if anyone reading the code can't even work out what it does

No points/prizes - just the admiration/disgust of your fellow developers.

### Notes

No additional libraries allowed - standard Java should provide more than enough scope<br>
The tests should be correct, but let me know if they're not
